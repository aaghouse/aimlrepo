
Data:
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50).

Deliverables:
Your final product should be a brief report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons. To explore the data you will utilize your knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python. You will publish your findings in a public facing github repository as your first portfolio piece.

Data Analysis & Observations

Data Set or Sample Data Analysis:
---------------------------------
	
Data seems to have a proper distribution of data -married vs Single vs unmarried, 
much less of a data sample of Divorced and widowed. (or) probably due to the fact that Divorced/Widowed go less often out to socialize.

Unemployed & Student people tend to be more on the road compared to people with other occupation
Probably with the invent of gig economy, Uber and Lyft this group commutes more on trips and represent the 
close to 27% of the sample dataset. worth exploring histograms of the occupation vs count.

Dataset is primerily of income < $125K, It seems to suggest either the data set is not in prime income density location or the groups that are travelling is more of younder crowd servicing the rich population.

Alone - passengers does not qualify what they are doing while travelling
Nan on the carryaway can skipped out while analyzing, It represent  only 1%, This column with rows on carryAway with Null data can be safely ignored for analysis.

car column is almost empty with null values and can be safely ignored,  99% has null values in it.
Bar, CoffeeHouse, CarryAway, RestaurantLessThan20 & Restaurant20To50 have minimal null counts ( If relevant for data analysis, < 1% and those rows can be dropped)

Observation on null values.
car column has 12576 null values.
Dropping car column which adds minimal value to analysis.
Very few filled values in terms of records or rows and can be safely dropped.

--------------- 
Out of the total sampled population almost ~55+% choose to accept the coupon, ~40+%
declined the coupon.Analysis based on data on who accepted the coupon and why follows below.
 
Groups of coupons offered characteristics.
Carry out&Take away, Restaurant(<20) and Coffee House coupons dominated the
coupons offering followed by Bar and Restaurant(20-50)

Based on the analysis Bar frequenters seem to accept the coupons more often
than others ( 59% )accepted vs  targetting sale of coupons to Bar frequenters will produce better
coupon acceptance stats.

Among Bar visitors (62%) accepted the coupons who frequented the bar > 3
times. compared to (56%) accepted the coupons who frequented the bar =< 3
times.

Bar monthly visitors > 1 time and over the age of 25.
13.6% accepted compared to the total sampled data
17.4% accepted compared to every one else.

Bar monthly visitors > 1 time,no kids on passengers list & occupation other
than farming, fishing or forestry.
57.3% accepted 
42.6% declined.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Observatoin on bar visitors > 1 time a month, no kids and not widowed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
57.4% accepted the coupon and 42.5% declined.

Reasons observed:
-----------------
  Single, Married with Partner and Un-married partner groups counts seem to accept it
more than divorced. If the coupons can target this specific group by bundline
other promotions for this group this effort will end up with more acceptance rate.

  Timing of the offering seems very telling 6:00PM, 7:00AM and 10:AM
travellers seem to accept it more. Offer periods during this peak-driving hours
could be more effective to get higher acceptance rate.

Income groups 25,000 - 37,499 highest acceptance followed by
12,500-24,999
37,500 - 49,999
100,000  or more
&
50,000 - 62,499
All other incoume groups are much smaller. Targetting this group would be more
beneficial to increase acceptance.

Most important result/Observation based on data analysis:
---------------------------------------------------------
How can we positon to get most people to accept coupons ?

Coupons targetting 5 minutes to coupon location had 100% success/acceptance rate of
acceptance, 15 minutes to coupon location had 51%.
Coupons targetting 25 minutes to coupon location had 91% failure/decline rate.
This suggests to not target coupons with loctions with 25 minutes drive.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Recording the Observation of three specific groups listed below:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Compare the acceptance rates between those drivers who:
go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed OR
go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 OR
go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.?

Group 1 #bargt1_no_kids_notwidow - (DataFrame)group go to bars more than once a month, no kid in passengers and not widowed
Group 2 #bargt1_age_lt30 - (DataFrame)group go to bars more than once a month and age under 30.
Group 3 #cheap_rest_lt50k - (DataFrame)cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K

In Group1 (OR) Group2 (OR) Group3 above below are the analyzed results.

Observation:
In these three groups of people
bargt1_nokids_notwidow_agelt30,
bargt1_age_lt30 &
bargt1_nokids_notwidow_agelt30.
59.39% accepted the coupon and 40.60% declined the coupons.
100% of the people accepted the coupon if the coupon destination is 5 mins away.
53.5% of the people accepted the coupon if the coupn destination is 15 mins away.
Only 12.5% of the people accepted the coupn if the coupon destination is 25 mins away.
Conclusion Always offer coupons to the nearest destinations preferably less than 5 min's away.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis on Coupon acceptance based of the drivers who accepted the coupon

Observation:
Single, married partner and unmarried partners visiting visitng bar > 1 time seem to overwhelmingly accept coupons.
Timing of the coupon(peak-driving times) offer impacts acceptance rate greatly, best times are 6:00PM, 7:00AM and 10:00AM
It also appears single people, married/unmarried couple seem to visit bar more often and they are the ones who accept the coupon.
Coupons tend to be accepted closer (5 mins drive) locations much more often
then others(100% acceptance rate).Followed by 15 min drive destinations(51%
acceptance rate) and lastly followed by 25 min drive locations(9.6%).
People accept coupons with expiration of 1 day compared to 2hours. This
indicates they are like to choose their prefered time rather than rushed to use
the coupon.

People decline coupons if the copons are presented at the off-peak work hours
2pm or 10pm. (or) If the coupon is in the same direction as they are going to
their destination (indicating them reaching their destination is a higher
priority, potentially these are gig workers lyst of Uber). Coupons get
declined also if they are more than 15 mins or definately decline more than 25Mins to
their coupon destination.

If we want to get more acceptance of the coupons potential groups of people
to target are single/married-partner/unmarried-partner groups driving.
People going to bars more than ones are also good targets.Faveroable times to
get the coupons to be accepted are 6:00PM, 7AM and 10AM. ( peak driving hours)
It would also be faveroable to give the coupons to drivers in the opposite
direction of their driving destination allowing them time to complete their
driving goals.  
 

Other Observation  based on Analysis:
-------------------------------------
Observation seems to reaffirm the proximity importance of the coupon location
If coupon destination is 25 mins away 90% of the customers decline coupons
If coupon destination is 15 mins away 51.1% accept the coupon and 48.8% decline.
Infering closer the distance of the coupon bette are the chance of coupon acceptance.

------
Inspired by the Bar group analysis and motivation. 
Questions to ponder: 
which group accepted more coupons drivers travelling the same direction as coupon destination or opposite ? Whatis the probability ?
Among the group that accepted it ? Which 'coupons' were actually accepted more ?
What was the expiration period of the coupons that got accepted more and what was the expiration period of 
the coupons that got declined.

Observation:
Drivers accept more coupons where the coupon destination is in the opposite direction (78%) compared to the coupons
destination on the same direction (21.9%). This could potentially be because they are more time sensitive to reaching the 
destination then a detaour or a stop. This could indicate that it may be Gig employees driving Uber or Lyft 
more focused on getting to the destination satisfying the customer as a goal.

Among the accepted coupons in the opposite direction restaurant(<20), Coffee House and Carry out & Take away seem to be 
the mist accepted coupons. This indicates that the population accepting the coupons frequent these places more.
This cound indicate they are busy folks putting in more hours at work and spend little time on high end restaurants 
or bars.

Examining expiration of the coupons 1day coupon seem to be accepted more than the 2hour coupons. People prefer to use 
the coupon over their prefered time of the day rather than rushed into 2h usage.
